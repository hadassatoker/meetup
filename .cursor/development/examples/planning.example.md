## Project Task Plan: [Project Name]

### Phase 1: Planning & Design
- [ ] Task 1.1: Define Project Scope & Requirements: Clearly outline the project's goals, features, target audience, and constraints.
- [ ] Task 1.2: Research & Technology Selection: Investigate relevant technologies, APIs, libraries, and frameworks. Make decisions on the tech stack.
- [ ] Task 1.3: Define Data Structures/Models (DTOs/Schemas): Specify the format and structure of data the application will handle.
- [ ] Task 1.4: Outline High-Level Architecture: Create a diagram or document (architecture.md/PLANNING.md) describing the main components and their interactions.
- [ ] Task 1.5: Define Project Phases & Milestones: Break down the project into logical phases and set key milestones.
- [ ] Task 1.6: Create Initial Task List (TASK.md): Populate this document with specific tasks for the initial phases.

### Phase 2: Core Implementation (MVP)
- [ ] Task 2.1: Setup Project Structure: Create initial directories, core application files (e.g., main.py, app.js), configuration files, requirements.txt/package.json, .gitignore, README.md, .env.example.
- [ ] Task 2.2: Implement Core Data Models: Code the defined DTOs, schemas, or data structures. Include data validation and parsing logic if applicable.
- [ ] Task 2.3: Implement Core Service/Module 1 (e.g., Data Fetching/API Client): Develop the first essential functional component. Include basic error handling.
- [ ] Task 2.4: Implement Core Service/Module 2 (e.g., Data Processing/Parsing): Develop the next essential component, potentially processing data from Module 1.
- [ ] Task 2.5: Implement Core Service/Module 3 (e.g., Output/Notification/API Endpoint): Develop the component responsible for delivering the result or interacting externally.
- [ ] Task 2.6: Implement Configuration Management: Load necessary settings (API keys, URLs, database credentials) from environment variables or config files.
- [ ] Task 2.7: Integrate Core Components: Write the main application logic to orchestrate the interaction between the core modules. Add basic logging.
- [ ] Task 2.8: Define Initial Dependencies: List all necessary libraries and packages in the appropriate dependency file.
- [ ] Task 2.9: Create Example Environment File (.env.example): Provide a template for required environment variables.

### Phase 3: Feature Enhancement & Refinement
- [ ] Task 3.1 (Optional): Implement State Management/Persistence: Add functionality to save and load application state or data (e.g., to a file or database).
- [ ] Task 3.2 (Optional): Integrate State Management: Modify the main application logic to use the state management features (e.g., avoid reprocessing data).
- [ ] Task 3.3: Refine User Output/Interface: Improve the formatting, presentation, or user interaction aspects of the application.
- [ ] Task 3.4: Add Robust Error Handling & Logging: Implement comprehensive error catching, retries, and detailed logging throughout the application.
- [ ] Task 3.x: Implement Feature X (e.g., Filtering, User Authentication): Add a specific new feature based on project requirements. Update data models if needed.
- [ ] Task 3.y: Implement Feature Y: Add another specific new feature.
- [ ] Task 3.5: Add Unit/Integration Tests: Write tests (e.g., using pytest, Jest, JUnit) for key components and functionalities. Aim for good coverage.

### Phase 4: Testing, Documentation & Finalization
- [ ] Task 4.1: Write Comprehensive README.md: Include a detailed project description, setup instructions (dependencies, configuration), usage examples, and contribution guidelines (if applicable).
- [ ] Task 4.2: Code Cleanup & Linting: Ensure code adheres to style guides (e.g., PEP 8, Prettier), add docstrings/comments, and ensure consistent type hinting.
- [ ] Task 4.3: Perform End-to-End Testing: Conduct thorough testing of the complete application workflow.
- [ ] Task 4.4: Final Code Review: Have team members review the codebase for quality, consistency, and potential issues.
- [ ] Task 4.5 (Optional): Prepare for Deployment: Create deployment scripts, Dockerfile, or CI/CD pipeline configurations.
