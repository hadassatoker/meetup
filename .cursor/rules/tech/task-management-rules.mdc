# Task Management Rules

## 1. File Structure and Location
- All task-related files MUST be stored in the `.cursor/development` directory
- Required files for each feature/task:
  - Task Definition File (following task.example.md format)
  - Planning File (following planning.example.md format)

## 2. Task Creation Process Flow

### Step 1: Task Definition
1. Create a new task file in `.cursor/development`
2. Follow the structure from task.example.md template, including:
   - Task Title
   - Task ID
   - Detailed Description
   - Acceptance Criteria
   - Dependencies
   - Subtasks
   - Timeline Information
3. Wait for explicit task approval before proceeding

### Step 2: Implementation Planning
1. After task approval, create a planning file in `.cursor/development`
2. Follow the structure from planning.example.md template, including:
   - Project phases
   - Detailed subtasks
   - Dependencies
   - Timeline estimates
3. Wait for explicit planning approval before proceeding

### Step 3: Implementation Phase
1. DO NOT begin any implementation work until receiving explicit permission
2. Even if both task and planning files are approved, wait for explicit "start implementation" instruction

## 3. Validation Requirements
- Task file must comprehensively cover all implementation aspects
- Any unclear or poorly characterized aspects must be flagged and clarified
- Planning file must break down the implementation into detailed, actionable subtasks

## 4. Approval Gates
1. Task Definition Approval Gate
2. Planning Approval Gate
3. Implementation Start Approval Gate

## 5. Communication Protocol
- Raise questions about unclear requirements immediately
- Request clarification for any ambiguous aspects
- Confirm understanding before proceeding to next steps

## 6. Change Management
- Any changes to approved task or planning files must go through the approval process again
- Document all changes and their rationale

Remember: No implementation work should begin until ALL three gates (Task, Planning, and Implementation Start) have received explicit approval.
