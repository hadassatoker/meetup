# Development Environment Interaction


This rule defines how to construct API endpoints for the development environment.


- **Base URL:** `http://kube-lb.fiverrdev.com/`
- **Endpoint Structure:** `{Base URL}<APP_NAME>/{ROUTE}`


**Example:**


To interact with the `catalog-pegasus` application at the `api/v1/seller-ai-model/catalog` route, the full endpoint would be:
`http://kube-lb.fiverrdev.com/catalog-pegasus/api/v1/seller-ai-model/catalog`


**Usage:**


When asked to interact with an application in the 'dev' environment, replace `<APP_NAME>` and `<ROUTE>` with the specific application name and API route provided in the request.
