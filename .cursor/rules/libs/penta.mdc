# Fiverr UI Component Library Access Guidelines

## When to Use
This rule applies when:
- Working on React components
- Building or modifying frontend code
- Implementing UI elements that may already exist in Fiverr's component library

## Repository Reference
Always search the Fiverr UI component library repository before creating new components:

- **Repository**: `fiverr/penta_sphinx`
- **Description**: Fiverr's official UI component library containing reusable React components
- **Access Method**: Use GitHub MCP tools to search and reference components

## Search Process
When implementing UI components, follow these steps:

1. **Search First**: Always check if a UI component already exists in penta_sphinx before creating one from scratch
   ```
   mcp_github_search_code repo:fiverr/penta_sphinx <component_name>
   ```

2. **Check Structure**: Review the component's implementation details
   ```
   mcp_github_get_file_contents owner:fiverr repo:penta_sphinx path:/packages/<component_path>
   ```

3. **Follow Patterns**: Implement components following the same patterns and structures found in penta_sphinx

## Component Structure
Most components in penta_sphinx follow this structure:
- `index.tsx` - Main component implementation
- `types.ts` - TypeScript interfaces and types
- `constants.ts` - Component constants
- `style.ts` - Styling using the Fiverr theming system
- `spec.tsx` - Component tests

## Integration Guidelines
- Always use the same prop patterns and naming conventions
- Maintain consistency with the penta_sphinx component design patterns
- Respect theming and styling approaches used in the library

## Example Search Commands
To find a button component implementation:
```
mcp_github_search_code repo:fiverr/penta_sphinx Button
mcp_github_get_file_contents owner:fiverr repo:penta_sphinx path:/packages/button/src/components/Button/index.tsx
```

To find styling patterns:
```
mcp_github_search_code repo:fiverr/penta_sphinx style.ts
```
